# Radial-Basis-Neural-Networks
The RBNN is a two-layered network that comprises of a hidden layer of radial-basis neurons, and an output layer of linear neurons. The hidden-layer performs a non-linear transformation of input space to an intermediate space, and output layer then implements a linear combiner to produce the desired targets.
